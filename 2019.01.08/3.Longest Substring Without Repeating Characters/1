Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring 
without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, 
             "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
         int freq[256] = {0};

        int l = 0, r = -1; // sliding window: s[l...r]
        int res = 0;

        while (r + 1 < s.size()) {

            if (freq[s[r + 1]] == 0) {
                r ++;
                freq[s[r]] ++;
            } else {
                freq[s[l]] --;
                l ++;
            }
            
            res = max(res, r - l + 1);
        }

        return res;

    }
};
